# strlantian.github.io

Hello

Recently I got serveral troubles like

I cannot open the repository page(github.com/Strlantian/strlantian.github.io) on my computer

But the github page(strlantian.github.io) is accessible

I tried all the methods like using VPN, use private mode, use git and so on but they didn't work

The only method is using github.dev

That wired though because I can open the repo page on any other computers

So I wonder if some1 has the same situation or knows how to solve this

Thx a lot for answering
